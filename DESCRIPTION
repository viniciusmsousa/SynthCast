Description: Not a new method implementation.
    Usage of the Synthetic Control Method, see Abadie et al. (2011) <doi:10.18637/jss.v042.i13>,
    as an ad-hoc approach to forecast series with panel in a specific context. The context being: There are units in different stages of a certain journey, there the assumption that the unitsâ€™ behavior throw out the journey are similar is valid and there are not enough data to use traditional forecasting methods. 
    For a usage example see the package home page documentation.
